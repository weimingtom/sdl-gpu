# What is it? #

SDL\_gpu is a rendering system for SDL 1.2 and SDL 2.0 (http://libsdl.org/) that presents a powerful hardware-accelerated API for 2D applications and games.  The source code is portable to a variety of platforms which have SDL and OpenGL support, including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, iOS, and Android.  The library and demos can be built for most platforms by using CMake (http://www.cmake.org/).


# Where do I get it? #

Binary builds are available in the 'builds' directory of the repository:
https://code.google.com/p/sdl-gpu/source/browse/#svn%2Fbuilds

If you want to build the source yourself, just grab a copy of the repository via SVN.  See the [README](https://sdl-gpu.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README.txt) for details.

## Tutorials ##

DinoMage Games has produced a simple tutorial for getting a sprite on the screen with SDL\_gpu:

## Demos ##

The demos directory contains a suite of test programs for the various available features.  Perusing these demos is the best way to get a feel for what SDL\_gpu can do.  The "init" demo is the base project for many of the other demos, so it is a good place to start.


## Documentation ##

SDL\_gpu is currently in feature development.  As such, features are liable to be added or changed in the future.  This means that the documentation is also changing.  The header comments are kept up-to-date, so the best documentation can be generated directly via Doxygen.  However, you can find pregenerated documentation in the source repository or online at:
http://dinomage.com/reference/SDL_gpu/


# How am I allowed to use it? #
